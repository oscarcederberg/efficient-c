## Clock cycles per iteration

### Instructions
```c
for (i = 0; i < N; i += 1)
	a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
```

for each iteration, the following has to be done (with naive estimate of instructions called for each part):
1. check if i < N (load i, load N, compare, jump)
2. increment i (load i, add 1, store i)
3. add b[i] + c[i] (load i, load b[i], load i, load c[i], add)
4. store to a[i] (load i, store a[i])
5. return to 1. (jump)

in our estimate, we find 15 instructions per iteration. different instructions would most likely hav different clock cycles.

```
from this we can gather that in actuality the instruction cound is 6.

### scrollpv
#### a
Clock cycles: 49 -> 341\
Total cycles: 292\
Cycles per iteration: 2.92

#### b
Clock cycles: 51 -> 654\
Total cycles: 603 ->
Cycles per iteration: 6.03

the discrepency is most likely from all the red s's. "cannot issue sources not ready".

### Rename register
Renaming registers is when registers are renamed to allow out-of-order execution. There might be registers that are used in several branches or parts of the code that are not dependant on each other. By using a different register these parts can be run without having to wait for each other.
